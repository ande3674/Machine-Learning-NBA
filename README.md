## UMN Data Visualization &amp; Analytics Bootcamp: Final Project  

For our final project, we use National Basketball Association player and team statistic data to explore machine learning concepts.  

### Purpose:  
To predict the outcome of basketball games. 

### Project involves:  
* Datawork
  * API calls to https://www.balldontlie.io/#getting-started to retrieve data  
  * Cleaning Data (Python)
  * Choosing data parameters for use in machine learning models  
    * Chosen: Player height, weight, and age weighted by playtime in game
  * Saving Data to CSV

* Developing Machine Learning Models
  * Choosing models  
    * Chosen: Deep Neural Network
  * Training models  
  * Testing models  
  * Saving models  

* Website Design  
  * Setting up Flask Server (Python)
  * HTML
  * CSS  
  * Javascript  
    * Calls Flask server to retrieve player stats and run machine learning model
  * Hosting Website
